# Automatic Quests

Have you ever <cr>forgotten</c> to claim a completed quest, then collected a lot of <cj>rewards</c>, then got <cr>frustrated</c> that you missed out on using those rewards to make progress on the next quest?

No? Just me???

Well, to anyone who wants to complete your quests as efficiently as possible, <cy>**this mod is for you!**</c>

## How it Works

This is a simple mod that <cy>**automatically claims your quests**</c> when you complete them! Upon completing a quest, the rewarded <cj>diamonds</c> will be automatically added to your profile, and the <cp>quest notification</c> will display your next upcoming quest. 

You can then <cg>***immediately make progress***</c> on the next quest without having to go back to the quest menu and claim it! No extra setup required! So efficient!!!

## Customization

This mod is <cp>highly configurable</c>, with several customizable options:

- Show upcoming quests in the quest notification
- Show the diamonds earned from completing a quest
- Change how long the quest notification stays visible

Go to the <cj>mod settings</c> to see all the possible config options!

## Issues

If you find a <cr>problem</c> with the mod or have any <cp>suggestions</c>, please create an issue on the mod's [GitHub](https://github.com/glow13/AutomaticQuests/issues) page.

This mod has been extensively tested by me, but there is still a possibility that something breaks, so please report any bugs you find!
