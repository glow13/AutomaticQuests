# Automatic Quests

Have you ever forgotten to claim a quest, collected a ton of rewards, then got frustrated that you missed out on using those rewards to make progress on the next quest? No? Just me???

Well, to anyone who wants to complete your quests as efficiently as possible, this mod is for you!

## How it Works

This is a simple mod that automatically claims your quests when you complete them! Upon completing a quest, the diamonds will be added to your profile, and the quest notification will display your next upcoming quest. 

You can then immediately make progress on the next quest without having to go back to the quest menu and claim it! No extra setup required! So efficient!

## Issues

If you find a problem with the mod or you think the mod is messing up your statistics, please create an issue on the mod's [GitHub](https://github.com/glow13/AutomaticQuests/issues) page.

This mod has been extensively tested by me, but there is still a possibility that something breaks, so please report any bugs you find!
